whenever u want a local repo intialized then use
1. git init | git init --initial-branch = name

to check whether git knows about the file 
git status

to add files to local repo 
git add . all untracked files
git add <file_name> only a particular file. when we add like this the information is sent to staging area.

(use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

git commit -m message (we cant bring back files if we dont commit it) this takes a snapshot of local repo.

git log gets the commits 

git log
commit comit ssh (HEAD -> main)
Author: name emial
Date:   time in utc

First Commit 
a branch is created when u do the first commit
as branch is created a HEAD variable is created
it is a pointer to the latest commit 

ok when new commit are created the previous commit information also comes

when u edit the files which are commited or in staging are if u modify it git can track it.
when u modify again u have to add it to staging area and then commit.

git commit -a -m message commits the file without the add to staging area. use this only with tracked files which are tracked by git.
git commit --amend // the previous latest commit can be added with the current staged files.

suppose there is f2 file which is changed and i dont want to create a new commit object but want to the commit with the previous latest commit then use git commit --amend

logs
git log shows all
git log -n 2 last 2 commit only shown
git log --pretty=short|full (controls the output style);
git log -p (shows all the commits made in the staging)
git log --since="1 week ago"  shows all the commits in last one week

Undo commits
git reset -> provides a way to unstage a file and undo commits and delete commits.
types of reset soft mixed hard.
git reset ---soft commitId try to use only the previous commits // changes in the commit are unstaged.
PS D:\git-practice> git reset --soft 2d7af9e8ac069645451499a162d33ce9fee051eb
